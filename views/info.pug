However, as we continued to progress through our checkpoints, we recognized the numerous complexities we faced. From figuring out the communication levels of our code structure [REPHRASE], to learning how to work with Pug for the first time, we were able to understand the importance of making wise decisions for both major and minor details.
                                            | Further, we identified the positive effects of weighing out the pros and cons of all our ideas, as we pushed to produce the best version of our application. Thanks to many trials and errors, we are proud of what we have accomplished, both with this service and in terms of our growth as software engineers.
